# Reminders
## Create a website with 4 pages
• index.html should take the OsloMet "MatMod"-page as point of departure and reproduce the content (not design) in HTML & CSS.
• One page must be "Accessibility" — see below
• One page must be "GitHub" — see below
• One Activity page should show an activity, a hobby, sport, interest or similar, and this page may have a different visual profile with colours and lay-out.

## All pages must share
• elements of visual design (e.g. colour palette, menu, etc., except "Activity")
• a similar HTML structure (e.g. use of semantic and sectioning elements), but the 'index.html'-page may have a more complex sectioning structure

## Comment your code
• A list of contents at the top of the CSS plus some "headings" in the CSS may be a good idea if it improves readability
• All sectioning element deserves a very short comment on what it does
• Classes that effect the lay-out usually deserves a very short comment on what it does
• The main purpose for the comments should be to help a future developer take over your project and develop it further; for examiners, it helps weed out the most obvious copied-code-withoutunderstanding issues

# NB:
The entire site will be checked on at least one narrow screen (portrait), one regular wide (16:9) and one ultrawide screen (21:9) — representing a mobile phone, a laptop, and a desktop. The same HTML + CSS should work well in all three formats! The site should work across at least two of the following, updated browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
